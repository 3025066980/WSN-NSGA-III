# WSN-NSGA-III
 Wireless sensors network deployment using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm.
 
# To run the expermints :
1- go to code and open configrationFile.m 

2- set the values of the Algorithm parameters that you want in the ConfData Array

3- run the code and the results willbe stored in results folder.

# To Show the results of expermints:
1- go to results folder

2- you can run one of this files :

-run plotResuts3D_pareto.m to show the comparasion btween NSGAII,NSGA3and MOJPSO

-run MplotSensors.m to plot the sensor distribution for NSGA3 

-run MplotStatistics.m to plot the execution time and sensors number statistics for NSGA3

-run plotResults2D.m to plot the pareto in 2D
